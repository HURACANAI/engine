# Huracan Engine v5.1

Huracan Engine is the reinforcement-learning training box that produces the nightly "Baseline Brain" for the Huracan trading stack. The project now ships a fully wired PPO agent, walk-forward shadow trading simulator, post-trade analytics backed by PostgreSQL + pgvector, health-monitoring control loop, **and comprehensive observability system** with AI-powered insights and interactive UIs.

## Highlights

- **Reinforcement learning agent** using PPO with contextual action biasing, running statistics, and gradient clipping ([src/cloud/training/agents/rl_agent.py](../src/cloud/training/agents/rl_agent.py)).
- **Shadow trading simulator** that walks historical data without lookahead, captures rich trade context, and feeds rewards back into the agent ([src/cloud/training/backtesting/shadow_trader.py](../src/cloud/training/backtesting/shadow_trader.py)).
- **Post-trade analytics suite** covering wins, losses, pattern stats, and post-exit tracking, all persisted via `MemoryStore` into PostgreSQL/pgvector ([src/cloud/training/analyzers](../src/cloud/training/analyzers), [src/cloud/training/memory](../src/cloud/training/memory)).
- **Confidence, regime, and feature importance models** packaged under [src/cloud/training/models](../src/cloud/training/models) to score trades before entry and explain outcomes.
- **Intelligence gates** (14 systems) that filter unprofitable trades through cost analysis, adverse selection detection, and meta-labeling.
- **Daily orchestration and monitoring** with Ray integration, health checks, alerting, and artifact publishing ([src/cloud/training/pipelines/daily_retrain.py](../src/cloud/training/pipelines/daily_retrain.py), [src/cloud/training/monitoring](../src/cloud/training/monitoring)).
- **Observability system** (33 modules) with event logging (113k events/sec), learning analytics, AI Council (7 models + judge), and 4 interactive UIs ([observability/](../observability/)).

## Getting Started

### 1. Prepare your environment

- Python **3.11** (pyenv or `python -m venv .venv` are both fine).
- PostgreSQL **14+** with access to install the `pgvector` extension.
- Optional: Ray cluster access if you plan to distribute daily retraining.

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Poetry is the supported workflow (the project file lives under `infrastructure/pyproject.toml`):

```bash
cd infrastructure
poetry install
poetry shell  # optional: spawn a shell with the environment active
```

If you prefer plain `pip`, mirror the versions from `infrastructure/pyproject.toml` (the quick setup script installs the critical ones: torch, polars, psycopg2-binary, scipy).

### 3. Configure PostgreSQL

1. Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is exported, e.g.
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL='postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/huracan'
   ```
2. Provision schema and pgvector tables:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup_database.sh
   ```
   The script validates connectivity, installs `vector`, and creates `trade_memory`, `post_exit_tracking`, `win_analysis`, `loss_analysis`, `pattern_library`, and `model_performance`.

### 4. Update configuration

- Edit `config/base.yaml` (or the environment-specific profile you are using) to supply the PostgreSQL DSN, exchange credentials, S3/artifact settings, and any overrides for the RL, shadow trading, memory, or monitoring blocks.
- `EngineSettings` can also read overrides from environment variables such as `HURACAN_ENV`, `HURACAN_MODE`, and `HURACAN_CONFIG_DIR`.

### 5. (Optional) Run the RL setup helper

`./scripts/setup_rl_training.sh` installs core Python dependencies (via Poetry), checks PostgreSQL connectivity, and ensures the docs/models directories exist.

## Running the Engine

- **Daily retrain pipeline** (loads data, runs shadow trading, updates the agent, publishes artifacts, executes health checks):
  ```bash
  ./scripts/run_daily_retrain.sh
  ```
  This script maps to `cloud.training.pipelines.daily_retrain:run_daily_retrain`.

- **Ad-hoc single-symbol training** with the RL pipeline:
  ```bash
  poetry run python - <<'PY'
from cloud.training.config.settings import EngineSettings
from cloud.training.pipelines.rl_training_pipeline import RLTrainingPipeline
from cloud.training.services.exchange import ExchangeClient

settings = EngineSettings.load()
if not settings.postgres:
    raise RuntimeError("Postgres DSN must be configured")

pipeline = RLTrainingPipeline(settings=settings, dsn=settings.postgres.dsn)
client = ExchangeClient(settings.exchange.primary, sandbox=settings.exchange.sandbox)
metrics = pipeline.train_on_symbol(symbol="BTCUSDT", exchange_client=client, lookback_days=365)
print(metrics)
PY
```

- **Continuous health monitoring** with structured logging and (optional) Telegram alerts:
  ```bash
  poetry run ./scripts/run_health_monitor.py
  ```

## Testing & Quality Gates

- Unit/integration tests: `poetry run pytest`
- Linting and formatting: `poetry run ruff check src tests` and `poetry run ruff format src tests`
- Static typing: `poetry run mypy src`
- System smoke test: `poetry run python tests/verify_system.py`
